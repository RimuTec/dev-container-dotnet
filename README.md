# dev-container-dotnet

This is a template repository for creating new repositories that use the same directory structure and files as this one.

This environment, which uses a dev container, is intended to be used for .NET 6.0 development using VS Code.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites (most recent stable version unless stated otherwise):
- VS Code
- Docker Desktop (MacOS, Windows) or docker engine (Linux)
- Remote development extension
- git client
- `devcontainer CLI`, follow instructions at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainer-cli

How to start:
1. Create clone of this repo
1. In a terminal, e.g., `bash`, and at the root of the cloned repo execute the following:
   ```bash
   devcontainer open .
   ```
   This will download docker images as needed, build docker images as need, then start the dev container and launch VS Code which remotely connects to the dev container. The repository clone is mounted into the dev container at path `/src`

The initial start may take several minutes if container base images need to be pulled first. Equally if you upgrade Docker Desktop (Windows, MacOS) or Docker Engine (Linux), the first startup after the upgrade may take several minutes as well.

## Creating Solution and Projects

Before you start using the template but after you have cloned it, I'd recommend renaming all occurances of `fooservice` in this repository to something that is more meaningful in your context.

Use commands such as `dotnet new` to create the solution file and one or more project files.

## Version Information

This version of the repo is for .NET SDK version 6.0.100.

You can use a different version of the .NET SDK by choosing a different base image in file `Dockerfile`. If you change the base image for the dev container, you also need to adjust the target framework in your `*.csproj` files (or equivalent).
