# Create non-root user

# Option '-m' to create home directory (see https://askubuntu.com/a/393470)
# Option '-s' to set shell for this user (see comment in https://askubuntu.com/a/393470)
# Option '-r' creates a system user which does not expire (see https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-users-in-linux-using-the-useradd-command/)

# Create working directory. Ownership will be changed in entrypoint.sh which
# executes *after* the volume has been mounted.
RUN mkdir /src

# Copy entrypoint script into container, make it executable, then make it the entrypoint for the container:
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh
# Option '+x' adds executable flag to the file
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]

# Install dotnet-outdated (see https://github.com/dotnet-outdated/dotnet-outdated)
RUN runuser -l dev -c "dotnet tool install --global dotnet-outdated-tool"
# runuser installs it as if the non-root user was installing it. This makes it available to that non-root user
ENV PATH "$PATH:/home/dev/.dotnet/tools"
